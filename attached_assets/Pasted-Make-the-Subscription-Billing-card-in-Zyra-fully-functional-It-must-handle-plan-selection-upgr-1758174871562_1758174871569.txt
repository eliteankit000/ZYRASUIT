Stripe (or Razorpay in India) for subscription management.

Supabase as database for storing: user_id, plan, status, invoices, payment method.

Webhook system: after successful payment → update Supabase subscription record.

Invoices: fetch from Stripe (or Razorpay) and display in billing history.

Upgrade/Downgrade: users can switch plans; handle prorated billing.

Cancel/Resume subscription: update in Stripe + Supabase.

🔹 APIs Needed

Stripe/Razorpay API → subscription checkout, invoices, payment methods.

Supabase → store subscription info + enforce limits.

OpenAI GPT-4o-mini + GPT-4o → usage caps per plan.

SendGrid + Twilio → enforce email/SMS quotas.

Shopify/WooCommerce API → sync plan-based features.

🔹 Deliverables

A working Subscription & Billing page in Zyra with the above functionality.

Plan enforcement: users on lower plans cannot exceed usage.

Upgrade flow: user clicks “Upgrade” → payment → auto-update plan in Supabase.

Billing history: invoices shown inside card.

Admin control: ability to override plans manually in Supabase.

⚡ Final Note: Make it clean, responsive, and consistent with Zyra’s gradient theme.
