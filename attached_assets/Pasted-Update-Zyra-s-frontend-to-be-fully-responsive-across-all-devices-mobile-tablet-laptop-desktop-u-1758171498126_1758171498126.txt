Update Zyraâ€™s frontend to be fully responsive across all devices (mobile, tablet, laptop, desktop, ultra-wide) with a sticky header that stays visible when users scroll up and down.

ðŸŽ¨ Layout & Responsiveness Rules

Mobile-first approach â†’ stack vertically on small screens, expand into grids/cards on larger screens.

Ensure spacing & readability:

Mobile text: text-sm â†’ text-base.

Buttons should remain tap-friendly on mobile (min-h-[44px]).

Keep Zyraâ€™s gradient theme consistent everywhere.
